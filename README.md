# ðŸ§  Plant Disease Classification using CNN
 
This project focuses on classifying plant diseases using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **Keras and TensorFlow**. The model is trained on a dataset of plant images and predicts the disease category based on image inputs.   ðŸš€  
 
 ---

 ## Dataset  
- The dataset contains images of **38 different plant disease categories**.  
- Images are stored in appropriate folders for training and validation.  
 
## **ðŸ›  Features**  

âœ” **Convolutional Layers** â€“ Extract spatial features from images  
âœ” **Batch Normalization** â€“ Speeds up training and stabilizes learning  
âœ” **MaxPooling** â€“ Reduces dimensionality and enhances feature extraction  
âœ” **Global Average Pooling** â€“ Reduces parameters and prevents overfitting  
âœ” **Dropout Regularization** â€“ Helps mitigate overfitting  
âœ” **Adam Optimizer** â€“ Ensures efficient training  
âœ” **Learning Rate Scheduler** â€“ Dynamically adjusts learning rate  
âœ” **Data Augmentation** â€“ Enhances dataset generalization
